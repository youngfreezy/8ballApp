to start the app, first clone the repo, then in the root of the project:

`npm run deps`

this will install both server and client side dependencies.

then, to start the app, in the root of the project:

`yarn dev`

to run tests, in the root of the project:

`npm run test a` (the `a` flag runs all tests)

(the last test throws a "network request failed" error which is caught by the application - this is expected).
